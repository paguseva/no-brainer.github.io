Hi! My name is Polina Guseva. I am a quantitative researcher at a hedge fund, where I work with cryptocurrency markets. Moreover, I have experience with platform development for quantitative analysis in Rust and kdb+/q.

Before this, I briefly participated in machine learning research about generative language models. My current interests broadly include ML for finance, bayesian models, and natural language processing.

I graduated with BSc in Applied Maths and CS from [HSE University](https://www.hse.ru/en/ba/ami) in 2022.

At the moment I am located in Yerevan, Armenia.
